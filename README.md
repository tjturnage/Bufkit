# Bufkit
classes and functions to manipulate Bufkit text files

The only script working at this point is the theta-e parser.ipynb - still working on getting the class versions working.
The point of the (working) theta-e script is to assess depth and magnitude of theta-e lapse rate by calculating this value at 500m increments AGL. The results are plotted in a timeseries.
